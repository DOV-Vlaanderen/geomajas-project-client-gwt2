  that don''t.
isFeaturesSupportedDescription=In this sample we distinguish WMS layer that support features and WMS layers that \
  don''t. WMS layer that support features have a lot more functionalities, and have a list of attribute descriptors \
  that describe the attributes of all features belonging to that layer.
