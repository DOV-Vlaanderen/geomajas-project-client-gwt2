    <title>What does this plugin do?</title>

    <para>In short, this plugin provides a set of services and utilities for
    editing and manipulating geometries. If at any time you need to create new
    geometries, split existing geometries, or simple calculate buffers, etc.
    this plugin does just that.</para>

    <para>A short overview of functionalities currently within this
    plugin:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Visually manipulating the shape of a geometry on the map. This
        allows the user interact with the map to create new geometries or
        change the shape of existing geometries. This is often used to change
        the geometries of features on the map, or for redlining, or
        ....</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Snapping: While editing a geometry, it is possible to apply
        snapping rules that help the user during geometry editing. This
        snapping rules are fully customizable.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Splitting geometries: A separate service has been created where
        the user can draw a line to split a geometry into multiple parts.
        (requires a dependency on the Geomajas server project)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Merging geometries: Using this functionality it is possible to
        create the union of several geometries. (requires a dependency on the
        Geomajas server project)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Here is a screenshot of what the default geometry editing within
    this plugin could look like:</para>

    <title>Maven configuration</title>

    <para>In order to use this plug-in in combination with the GWT face, the
    following Maven dependency is required:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas.plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-client-gwt2-plugin-editing-impl&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;<?eval ${project.version}?>&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>If you want splitting or merging support, you will have to use the
    following dependency:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas.plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-client-gwt2-plugin-editing-server-extension&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;<?eval ${project.version}?>&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This in turn includes a dependency on the Geomajas server
    project.</para>
