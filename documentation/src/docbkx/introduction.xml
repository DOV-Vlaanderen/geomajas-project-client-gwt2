  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The Geomajas GWT client is an AJAX client for the Geomajas Server,
  based upon the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). The goal of this client is to
  provide a lean and mean mapping API for the web. This library does not focus
  on providing GIS oriented widgets, but instead focuses on a central map
  concept.</para>

  <para>The usage of the Google Web Toolkit as a base, let's the user develop
  his Ajax application in Java, using his favourite Java IDE (Eclipse,
  IntelliJ, Netbeans, ...) and all the Java tools he is used to having around.
  Basically GWT is an efficient Java to Javascript compiler that only compiles
  and obfuscates that part of the libraries that you're actually using in your
  application. This means that classes that are not used will not be a part of
  the final build. These and many other tricks are used to optimise the
  Javascript that comes out at the end, making the footprint for Geomajas
  applications as small as can be. As a result of all this optimization, the
  memory consumption within the browser is also kept at a minimum, while
  performance is kept at maximum.</para>

  <para>An added bonus of these optimizations is that this API is also
  perfectly suited in mobile environments.</para>
