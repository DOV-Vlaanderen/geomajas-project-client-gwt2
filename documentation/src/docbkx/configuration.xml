  <title>Configuration</title>

  <para>In order to use the Geomajas client 2.x in your web application, there
  are a few steps you need to take.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Adding Geomajas Client 2.x to your project</title>

    <para>First of all, you will need to add the correct dependencies. Using
    Maven, this would be:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-client-gwt2-impl&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;<?eval ${project.version}?>&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>After the libraries have been added to your application, it's time
    to configure the correct GWT module. When writing applications in GWT, you
    need to precisely mark which packages or classes make up your client, so
    the GWT compiler knows where to look when compiling Java classes to
    Javascript.</para>

    <para>How to set up a GWT application and declare an EntryPoint is beyond
    the scope of this document. You'll have to visit the GWT documentation
    site for more information. What you do need to know is the definition of
    the Geomajas GWT module definition.</para>

    <para>In your .gwt.xml file, add the following line to include the
    Geomajas client:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;!-- Geomajas Client 2.x --&gt;
&lt;inherits name="org.geomajas.gwt2.GeomajasClientImpl" /&gt;</programlisting>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Using the Geomajas Client 2.x together with the Geomajas
    Server</title>

    <para>By making use of the Geomajas server project, a lot more
    functionalities become available, such as server-side layer definitions
    with build-in security etc. Should you want to make use of that,
    additional configuration is required.</para>

    <para>First of all, you'll need the following dependency:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.geomajas&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;geomajas-client-gwt2-server-extension&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;<?eval ${project.version}?>&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This dependency will pull the Geomajas server project into your
    project.</para>

    <para>Next, you'll have to include the GWT module into your .gwt.xml
    file:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;!-- Geomajas Client 2.x Server Extension --&gt;
&lt;inherits name="org.geomajas.gwt2.GeomajasClientServerExtension" /&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Next, you will have to configure your web.xml file to set up the
    Geomajas WebServices. Details on how to set up the Geomajas backend can be
    found in the backend documentation files.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>At this moment the Geomajas server project takes on a lot of
      responsibilities. It is therefore recommended you make use of it. For
      example, most layer types (WFS, Database, Shape, ...) are provided in
      the form of server-layers. Their client counterparts are on the roadmap,
      but not available yet.</para>
